        <strong><a id="defGenInfo"></a>Why the Jungle Matters</strong></p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        Jungles are vital for our planet and can be a source of exciting moments of adventure to be exchanged with
        others on <a href="http://www.bryxe.com">Bryxe</a>. Keeping our planet clean and healthy is clearly vital and
        yet few have ventured into jungles to understand how important they are.<br><br>
        Take just one example, the Amazon jungle. It is huge and is often called the lungs of our world due to a size of
        2.1 million square miles (5.5 million square km), representing over half of the rainforests on the planet. It
        has an estimated 390 billion trees with 16,000 species, which does not include a countless quantity of different
        types of vegetation. Losing those lungs clearly would not be a good thing, let alone the vegetation which
        already has given us cures for many of man's ailments and probably has many other remedies waiting to be
        discovered.<br><br>
        So why not take a moment right now to visit a typical jungle, right here. Let's follow a short trek that was
        made by a friend through that jungle, described by him in <a href="http://www.bryxe.com/about/">Bryxe style</a>
        posts.</p><br><br>

        <strong></a>Entering the Jungle Looks Impossible</strong></p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        It looks and is dense. But walking around revealed a few better entry spots. After pushing and twisting, plus
        some scratches, and we are in. Hidden vines nearly tripped up one member.</p><br><br>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong></a>Inside the Jungle</strong></p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        Everything looks the same. Finding your way is not easy. No GPS signal at all. All those trees cut off any
        signal and also hide the sky and even the sun.</p><br><br>
    <blockquote>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong></a>Walking can be a Challenge</strong></p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        Though it all seems the same, you discover that everything changes constantly as you walk. There are lots of
        hidden obstacles.</p><br><br>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong></a>Vines, Vines and More Vines</strong></p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        They grow everywhere, including near the ground, some hard as wood. Lifting legs high is a good idea. Hopping
        definitely is not recommended!</p><br><br>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong></a>As you Hike the Variety of Vegetation Becomes Clearer</strong></p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        While at first it all seems to be the same, it is not. There is a lot of variety in the vegetation. You need to
        spend time inside to see the differences. Fascinating!</p><br><br>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong></a>Suddenly an Opening</strong></p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        We arrived at open space but filled with grass well above our heads. We have to go through it, making it hard to
        see our feet, holes, bumps or other inhabitants, let alone where we are headed.</p><br><br>
    <blockquote>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong></a>Yet Another Opening now Filled with Bamboo</strong></p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        Cutting through bamboo is not an option, nor is pushing through. Leaves cut hands, arms and legs and are razor
        sharp. We decided to go around this obstacle.</p><br><br>
    <blockquote>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong></a>Now a Small Gorge Inside the Jungle</strong></p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        A short climb down and a steep nearly vertical climb greeted us. The water below is crystal clear, much better
        than the bottled stuff. Hey, now the vines are a great help climbing up.</p><br><br>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong></a>Finished! An Amazing Experience and it Still Looks Hard to Enter</strong></p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        Looking back it seems impossible that we crossed this jungle. It was a slow trek (Naismith's rule won't help)
        but well worth it. The moments of this rich world will leave priceless memories.</p><br><br>
