        <strong>11.2. Arbitration<br></strong>
        Except as provided in § 11.5, you and ASC each agree to submit to binding arbitration in the event of any
        Dispute, as defined in Section 11.0. The arbitration will be held in Virginia before one arbitrator, on an
        individual basis and not as a class action. The arbitrator shall be from National Arbitration Forum, Box 50191,
        Minneapolis, MN 55405-0191 (www.arb-forum.com), and the arbitration shall be according the rules of the National
        Arbitration Forum. You expressly waive any right you may have to arbitrate a Dispute as a class action. You also
        expressly waive your right to a jury trial.<br><br>

        If you fail to select an arbitration organization within 30 days after notice from ASC, ASC may select the
        organization. You may obtain a copy of the rules of each organization by contacting the organization. In the
        event that any Dispute cannot be submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to the rules of any such
        organization, such event shall not affect the enforceability of this clause so long as the Dispute may be
        submitted to binding arbitration with one of the organizations. You and ASC shall agree on one arbitrator to
        conduct the arbitration and the arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the applicable rules. Each party shall
        be responsible for its own attorney, expert and other fees, unless such fees are awarded by the arbitrator to
        the prevailing party.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong>11.3. Arbitration Is Final<br></strong>
        The arbitrator's award is final and binding on all parties. The Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §1 et seq.),
        and not any state law concerning arbitration, governs all arbitration under this clause. Any court having
        jurisdiction may enter judgment on the arbitrator's award. If any part of this clause, other than waivers of
        class action rights, is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the remainder shall remain
        enforceable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the waiver of class action rights
        contained herein is not enforceable as to any person or persons, the provisions of Section 12.2 of these Terms
        of Service shall apply to such person or persons only, and all other persons shall continue to be governed by §
        11 of this Agreement.<br><br>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong>11.4. No Class Action<br></strong>
        This Agreement provides that all Disputes, except those stated in § 11.5, will be resolved by binding
        arbitration and not in court or by jury trial. IF A DISPUTE IS ARBITRATED, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE
        AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST THE COMPANY INCLUDING ANY
        RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. WITHOUT LIMITATION, THIS INCLUDES

        any statement, representation, warranty or agreement of the other party except for those expressly contained in
        the Agreement. THERE ARE NO CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS AGREEMENT, OTHER THAN THOSE
        EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.<br><br>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong>12.2. Choice of Law, Forum, and Venue<br></strong>
        THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES, GOVERN ALL MATTERS

        ITS INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE, AND ENFORCEMENT.<br><br>

        You have agreed in Section 11 to submit to binding arbitration. However, if Section 11 is found not to have
        legal affect by any court with jurisdiction over the Agreement, actions arising out of or related to the
        Agreement, and ASC itself, then you agree that any legal action or proceeding against ASC arising out of or
        related to the Agreement may be brought only in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
        Virginia, or in any court of the State of Virginia.<br><br>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong>12.3. Severability and Waiver<br></strong>
        ASC’s failure to exercise or enforce any right granted in the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such
        right.<br><br>

        If any provision of the Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you nonetheless
        agree that such court should endeavor to give full effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in such
        provision, and you agree that other provisions of the Agreement remain in full effect.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong>12.4. No Agency<br></strong>
        This Agreement creates no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee
        relationship between you and ASC, and intends no such relationship.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong>12.5. Survival<br></strong>
        Sections 10, 11 and 12 will survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement.<br><br>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong>12.6. Claim Time Limitation<br></strong>

        of or related to use of Bryxe™ or the Agreement must be filed within one year after such claim, cause of action,
        or other Dispute arises, or be forever barred.<br><br>
