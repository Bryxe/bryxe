                participants at any time</p></li>
        <li><p class="defaultTextStyle">Posts - each entry is called a post and is made up of a title, text and a
                picture. You have more space for the text: 40 characters for the title and 200 for the text, so 240
                characters in total. The text can exceptionally be expanded to 1200 characters</p></li>
        <li><p class="defaultTextStyle">Pictures keep their original rectangular shapes, not to cut or squeeze anything
                out</p></li>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong><a id="howTopWk"></a>How topics of interest work</strong></p>
    <p class="defaultTextStyle">Everyone is interested in something special, beyond wanting to find out about the latest
        news and see or share pictures with friends or people they like. So, it's nice to be able to have posts only
        related to your common special interests as well as general posts unrelated to anything specific. Bryxe's <i>Topics</i>
        lets you have posts only related to your special interests. Best of all, you can use the foundation of people
        who's general interests or activities you are viewing, to select and add topics they like and probably know a
        lot about. Viewers that are viewing your activities can do the same, adding their thoughts to your topics,
        making for a very rich and fun environment all around.</p><br>
    <p class="defaultTextStyle">How do topics work? After adding a topic, you select it and then only the contents of
        that topic of interest is shown. Other posts are not shown, until you change to view either general posts or
        another topic of interest.</p><br>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong><a id="howGrpWk"></a>How groups work</strong></p>
    <p class="defaultTextStyle">The most basic group is the public group. Everyone always is a public member and anyone
        can view the contents in there. On the other hand you the user, has full control over your private groups. You
        add members to whichever private group you wish to. When you do that, posts added to a private group can be seen
        only by members of that group.</p><br>
    <p class="defaultTextStyle">How does that work? Very simple. You select a group and after that, only the content of
        that group is shown. Contents of other posts placed in other groups are no longer shown, nor are the public
        group posts shown. You must select another group to see those posts. You only see your own posts, replies and
        reposts by other members to your posts. Posts of other members unrelated to your posts are not shown in the
        private posts. For that to happen, the other members need to add you to their groups.</p><br>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="defaultTextStyle">
            <strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>
        <p class="defaultTextStyle">Your posts are added to your groups and you only see replies and reposts of members
            you added to your group when that group is selected. You and each member has full control over who can see
            their own private contents. That means that you cannot see the contents of the same members you added to
            your private group. For that to happen those members must add you to their own private groups.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle"> Next, under <strong><a href="#listPosts">List of posts</a></strong>, you can see how
        posts are displayed and how public and private posts work.</p><br>

    <p class="defaultTextStyle">
        <strong><a id="listPosts"></a>List of posts</strong></p>
    <p class="defaultTextStyle">Here you have the main screen with your posts and the posts of friends you are viewing
        (or following). These are the components of the main screen:</p><br>
    <blockquote>
        <p class="defaultTextStyle">
            <strong>Menu and logo</strong></p>
        <p class="defaultTextStyle">A tap or click on the top left corner of the screen on the three horizontal bars and
            the Bryxe logo displays the menu, described in <strong><a href="#menuitems">Accessing the menu</a></strong>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="defaultTextStyle">
            <strong>Picture and name block</strong></p>
        <p class="defaultTextStyle">Next to the logo you have the picture of the user that is logged on, with the user’s
            full name next to that. Under the full name you have an icon indicating the group you are in, just before
            the identification of the group. In the example below the currently selected group is public. This is, in
            fact the only really public group, as all others are private and fully controlled by you.</p><br>
        <p class="defaultTextStyle">In the example shown below, there is a number 4 in red next to the group icon. That
            number tells you that there are more new, unread posts in a private group. <strong><a href="#newgroup">Choosing
                    a new group</a></strong> explains how to access different groups.</p><br>
        <p class="defaultTextStyle">
            <strong>New post icon</strong></p>
        <p class="defaultTextStyle">On the very top right of the screen is the icon to tap to create a new post, as
            explained in <strong><a href="#newpost">New posts</a></strong>.</p><br>
        <p class="defaultTextStyle">
            <strong>Activity tabs</strong></p>
        <p class="defaultTextStyle">Under the blue control bar you have four activity tabs:</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="defaultTextStyle"><strong>Posts -</strong> tap on this tab to see a list of posts, from your

            <li><p class="defaultTextStyle"><strong>Viewers -</strong> this tab displays a list of viewers who are
                    viewing your posts</p></li>
            <li><p class="defaultTextStyle"><strong>Viewing -</strong> displays a list of members whose posts you are
                    viewing. It is here that you can change any viewing relationship</p></li>
            <li><p class="defaultTextStyle"><strong>Search -</strong> lets you search for other members, such as to add
                    them to the viewing list. The outcome of the search is shown under this tab</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="defaultTextStyle">

        <p class="defaultTextStyle">Posts are displayed as a horizontal list with the most recent posts first, including
